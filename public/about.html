<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Ezey, I am a student at Tufts University 
  studying Cognitive Brian 
  I am a Junior at Tufts University with an eagerness to discover the 
  professional field of business analytics in conjunction with the field of 
  technology and computer science to positively impact large organizations. 
  As an individual who is interested in this convergence, I have been actively
  exploring these fields through a range of academic coursework and 
  extracurricular activities.

  I have recently decided to sharpen my coding 
  skills and pick up a new skills at the same time by taking the initiative 
  to learn Web Development my learning and becoming an expert in the foundations
  of HTML5, CSS, Java Script, Node, and so much more that is encapsulated
  in Web Development. I decided I wanted to do this becuase I have a passion 
  to learn and become an expert in many different fields that I am involved in.
  And I am confident that this shows my willingness and dedication 
  to over achive and become knowledagble in eveyrhting that I learn.
